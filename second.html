	<h2>Sometimes, when you least expect it, a big chill comes and swoops you right off your feet. The city, lately, has been windy and full of change. And, if there's something I've learned living here for this long, it's that a girl should always be prepared to brace the cold without having to sacrifice her cool. </h2>

	<h4>Some time last week, I spent the afternoon with an old friend, retracing the steps that lead us to the city. I'd been feeling a little melancholy or like suddenly the blocks were all turning to quicksand.So fast, so many moving parts. I swear I blinked and everything changed. At dinner, between merlot's and a shared Croque Monsieur, I found myself referring to living in Brooklyn as being "a lot like having a love-hate relationship". </h4>

	<br><p>Even when I'm on the subway to midtown, I find ample ways to stay distracted. You would be surprised the amount of service you can find underground, if you just hold your phone high enough! On-the-go, sometimes doesn't feel as fun as it sounds. It would be nice to find a small place to cuddle inside, to keep warm, feel spoiled. So, until I find the perfect winter nest to hide inside, I'll start with a little something, like this coat, to keep me happy but most importantly, warm. Sometimes, when you least expect it, a big chill comes and swoops you right off your feet.<p>
